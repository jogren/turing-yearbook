# Turing Yearbook

Turing Yearbook was built using the React framework. This app displays both staff and students, their names, quotes and superlative. Users also have the option to dynamically add either a student of staff member to display with the other data.

### Learning Goals

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Learn to pass information between components using props.
- Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.

### Technology Used
